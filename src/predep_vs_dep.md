# Pre-Dep vs Dep

What's the whole deal with this Pre-Dep business? Basically, I'm not 100% set on the semantics and syntax of the language, and some things are so in-flux that I'm not confident I can describe a "beta" form of the language and then just make small changes. More like I need to make an "alpha" of the language (Pre-Dep) , and then decide for real on some of the semantics which will get finalized and become the Dep language.

I chose the name Pre-Dep because in my opinion it's easier to describe the earlier state of a language using a different name than version number like Python 2 vs 3
