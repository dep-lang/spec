Temporary (Pre)Dep Language Specification

This will definitely move, at the very least to a markdown file in the source code.

Right now this is just going to be mostly example code to get this out here

# Purpose

Dep has one clear goal: if it compiles, it has been proven correct! 

The author adds "properties" to methods and classes that specify preconditions, postconditions, and representation invariants. With this information Dep can prove at compile time that all of your code meets these specifications.
