# Hello World

```dep
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

 * The program always starts in a function named `main`
 
 * `fn` means that a function is going to be defined here
 
 * Curly braces around the function body
 
 * Lines end in a semicolon (`;`)
 
Note: the `println!()` function is a macro, which is why it ends with a `!`
