# Hello World

```dep
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

 * `fn` starts a function
 
 * Program execution begins in a function named `main`
 
 * Curly braces around the function body
 
 * Lines end in semicolon `;`

Aside: The `println!()` function is a macro, which is why it ends with a `!`
