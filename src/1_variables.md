# Variables

In Dep, declare a new variable like so

```dep
int num = 401;
```

It contains:
 * Type 
 * Name 
 * Initial value (optional)

Dep has the usual primitive types `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`

Primitives all lowercase, but all user defined types including standard library types like `String` and `Vec` must use UpperCase
